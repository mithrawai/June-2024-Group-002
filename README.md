Welcome to the Group 002 repository for the WaiPRACTICE June 2024 cohort. This project, developed as part of the Women in AI GenAI WAIPractice 2024 initiative, features a study tool tentatively named **Study_Pal_Geo**. This tool is designed to be an effective study aid for a specific exam.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a study tool utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework to assist students in exam preparation. The project was chosen to address the following needs:

1. **Save Time:** Reduce aimless online searching by providing concise and targeted information.
2. **Clear Explanations:** Offer clear, exam-level explanations tailored to the specific needs of students.
3. **Curated Answers:** Avoid overly complex responses by curating answers to the exam's level.
4. **Reduce Stress:** Ensure reliability of information to minimize stress during exam preparation.

The initial focus of the project is on GCSE Geography, with plans to expand to other exam levels and boards in the future.

## Project Setup

This project utilizes a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework and is designed to work with free tools under limited CPU capabilities. The following decisions were made to streamline the project:

1. **Google Colab:** Used for its T4 GPU option. Note: The free version has a timeout limit.
2. **Google Drive:** Employed for accessing the Knowledge Database and saving embeddings, although this can be costly on the free 15 GB option.
3. **FAISS:** Chosen as a free Vector Database.
4. **Gemma 2B:** Selected for its streamlined Language Model capabilities.
5. **Knowledge Database:** Restricted to a small sample to manage resource limitations.

## Key Learnings

Throughout this project, the team gained insights into:

- The workings of a RAG framework and its role in enhancing responses generated by LLMs.
- Various tools used in GenAI tasks, such as chatbots and QA systems.
- Balancing cost-effective tools with model performance and the quality of generated answers.
- The time-intensive nature of tasks like saving, storing, and accessing embeddings.
- Adopting a goal- and task-based approach to group projects.

## Running the Project Locally

To run this project locally, please note the following:

- **Google Drive Setup:** Ensure you set up or adjust the root directory as needed.
- **Knowledge Database:** Currently supports only PDF files.
- **Hugging Face Tokens:** Required for accessing embeddings and models; ensure you have the necessary permissions.
